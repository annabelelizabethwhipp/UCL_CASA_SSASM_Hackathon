# UCL_CASA_SSASM_Hackathon
This folder contains my work from the Hackathon completed as part of the analysis

It contains maps produced using Tableau and Office for National Statistics data from the 2011 Census. The shape boundary file is from the EDINA website. 

There is also a Jupyter notebook which includes analysis undertaken in python. The data is imported, cleaned and standardised before several graphs are produced and a regression model is done.
